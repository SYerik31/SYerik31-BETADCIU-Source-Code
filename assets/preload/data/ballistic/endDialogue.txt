:botan-worried:Pico. What happened here!?
:pico-gunless-speakdark:faceright:He had a pretty cool looking gun and I got a little carried away.
:botan-worried:So you tried to kill them for it!?
:botan-angry:What were you thinking!?
:pico-gunless-dark:faceright:...
:botan-angry:Apologize to them right now!
:pico-gunless-speakdark:Sorry bout all this.
:fever-smile:No biggie.
:fever-confused:I mean you did try to kill us but this isn't really anything new for us.
:tea:We tend to get in to a lot of dangerous situations.
:botan-worried:Again, I'm so sorry all of this happened!
:botan-worried:Is there anything we can do to repay you for your kindness?
:fever-smile:Actually, we came here looking for a good place for our date.
:botan-smile:We're not really familiar with any places but we'd be glad to show you around town.
:fever-smile:That'd be great.
:tea-annoy:Are you sure we'll be safe roaming with the guy who just tried to kill us.
:botan-smirk:Don't worry.
:botan-angry:I'll make sure he doesn't do anything crazy again.
:pico-gunless-dark:...
:fever-smile:Alright then. We'll be in your care.
:fever-smile:Cmon Tea, let's go!
:tea-think:*sigh*
:tea:Alright.
